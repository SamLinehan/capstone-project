# evently-back-end

Description: A mobile event app that allows users to join the event they are attending and interact with other attendees in real time. Users search for an event (or create one if it does not exist) and are then directed to that eventâ€™s live feed. While on the live feed, users can create a post, read other posts, and select favorite posts.
